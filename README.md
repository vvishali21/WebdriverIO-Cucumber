npm install wdio-cucumberjs-json-reporter --save-dev

npm install cucumber-html-reporter --save-dev

    const cucumberJson = require('wdio-cucumberjs-json-reporter');

    exports.config = {
    // ...
      reporters: ["spec",
        // Like this with the default options, see the options below

            language: 'en',
        },
        ],
     ],

Step 5:  Create an index.js and specify the options.

        brandTitle: 'Final Test Summary',
        jsonDir: './reporter/json/',
        output: './reporter/cucumber-htmlreport.html',
